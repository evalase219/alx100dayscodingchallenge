I decided to join in alx 100 days coding challenge in order to
practice more in the coding field. In this challenge i decided
to learn and focus more  JavaScript. Today is day 1, i started
with a textbook "Eloquent_JavaScript_small" and today i was able
to cover loops and also practise how to code patterns.
